  >>  get_filedata_from_folder( "../code/phpcode/svc/svc.
      why 
       get_filedata_from_folder( "../code/phpcode/svc/svc.
      does not work ?

  >> trap all occurrances of 
     var _result = get_filedata_from_folder
     check which data is

  >> [test]
     * as all's working, add also mobius_map / circle, point methods (.. inversion, isometric ...)
     * test method registrations for all classes (mixing the compositions and not)

  >> handle operators conversion inside the code, according to directive (replace)
     example var _b = sin(_a) >> var _b = _a.sin();

  >> Final code
     * the syntax
     <return-type> function <identifier>(<datatype><param#1>,<datatype><param#2>){<code>}
     must turn into
     function <identifier>(<params>){<code>}

     * final code shall be built by concatenating these arrays

     this.final_code_array['predirectives'] = []; // at the top
     this.final_code_array['copy.functions'] = []; // for homymous functions return different datatype ...
     this.final_code_array['code'] = []; // following ...

     except 'code' chunk - to be filled now, other entries will be fulfilled as the following points
     will be resolved

     Resolve final concatenation now

  >> simulate load, registration of function from .lib files
     (first from a string var, later by loading the files from server, later
      again from code editor)
     example:
     complex function fn1(p1, p2, ...)
     rect function fn2(p1, p2, ...)
     point function fn3(p1, p2, ...)

  >> example
     0: complex function test_add( _x, _y ){ return _x + _y ; }
     1: number function test_add( _x, _y ){ return _x + _y ; }

     2: var _a = new complex(1,1), _b = new complex(2,2);
     3: var _c = 1, _d = 2 ;

     4: var _t1 = test_add( _a, _b ) ;
     5: var _t2 = test_add( _c, _d ) ;

     candidate strategy:
     1. scan for functions defs
     2.1: test_add( _a, _b ) --> complex, fn id, complex, complex --> _complex_test_add
        from the related block of test_add (used as a pattern),
        create a temporary copy _complex_test_add
        and we get
        function _complex_test_add( _x, _y ) { return _x.add( _y ) ; }
        check duplicates inside this.final_code_array['copy.functions']
        if not yet, put it in

     2.2: test_add( _c, _d ) --> number, fn id, number, number --> _number_test_add
        from the related block of _number_test_add (used as a pattern),
        create a temporary copy _number_test_add
        and we get
        function _number_test_add_02( _x, _y ) { return _x + _y ; }
        check duplicates inside this.final_code_array['copy.functions']
        if not yet, put it in

     In this case, this.final_code_array['copy.functions'] shall be filled as follows:
     {
        original_fn_name : test_add,
        copy_fn_name : _complex_test_add,
        code_block : [ ... take code from the tree ... ],
        token_call_coords : [ 3, 3 ]
     },
     {
        original_fn_name : test_add,
        copy_fn_name : _number_test_add,
        reparsed_code : [ ... take code from the tree ... ],
        token_call_coords : [ 4, 3 ]
     }

     3. by means of the history table
     examine each call of 'test_add' (only ref, not def, thus those ones at rows 3 and 4)
     and find the class type of their arguments.
     find all occurrances for the pair return-type/fn_id and
     rename the fn_id of each block (if fn_id is def or ref) in the tree.
     Finally get the code from the whole tree again:

     0: function _complex_test_add( _x, _y ) { return _x.add( _y ) ; }
     1: function _number_test_add( _x, _y )  { return _x + _y ; }

     1: var _a = new complex(1,1), _b = new complex(2,2);
     2: var _c = 1, _d = 2 ;

     3: var _t1 = _complex_test_add( _a, _b ) ;
     4: var _t2 = _number_test_add( _c, _d ) ;

------------ SCRIPT EDITOR ------------------------
* OPERATORS MANAGEMENT
     >> operators do work on simple data type exclusively, then
        expressions in the form sin(z)+cos(z) are first evaluated
        into var1+var2, before the operator '+' is processed
     >> detect operator overloading declaration by
     (\w*)\s*(\boperator\b)(\W+)\((.*)\)
     yielding 4 groups:
     1) return data format
     2) 'operator' term
     3) operatori symbol
     4) comma-separated arguments data type
        for example
        rect operator+(rect, rect)
 
        when such regular expression is matched then the lexical analysis
        scans the further text until until the closing curl bracket '}' of
        level 0
        so that we can obtain the above 4 entries + the working function code,
        after building and evaluating the code
        "this.fn"+(++fn_id_counter)+" = function(arg1,arg2,...){"+code+"}" ;

        >> this should fill-in the basic operators array, together with
           a new entry in an internal catalogue of operators,
           structured as follow somehow
           ['+']
             |---->[args_n,'rect','rect',function(left_op,right_op){}]
             |---->[args_n,'number','number',function(left_op,right_op){}]
             |---->[args_n,'complex','complex',function(left_op,right_op){}]

           ['(+)']
             |---->[args_n,'farey','farey',function(left_op,right_op){}]

           ['-']
             |---->[1,'number',function(left_op){}]
             |---->[1,'complex',function(left_op){}]
             |---->[2,'complex','complex',function(left_op,right_op){}]
             |---->[2,'number','number',function(left_op,right_op){}]

        >> Find how to fill-in the default operators set along the above approach,
           as they have been already implemented into the parser. Then how can be
           read and reinterpreted into .compute_binary_atomic_expr (which will be
           finally renamed as .compute_atomic_expr)
   
  >> define the priority order for libs to be processed
     1) process special syntax and operators
     2) scan code for parsing formulas

  >> implement such translation into code.manager for script editor
     to do:
     a) methods in the test files shall be renamed with circles_lib_ nomenclature
        and put into file
     b) the operators.lib.js file will include two functions which will
        call methods in a) exclusively, no further processing of input expressions:
        everything is already included in such methods

  >> comments coloring handler
  >> scan for function to be included inside libs definition
     from foundation and framework
     (put files in libs/default.load)
  >> begin to plot something on a canvas, such as the isometric circle
        
* multicolor textarea (test codemirror)

------------- MATH -------------------------------------------------
* boundary tracer form:
  >> [TEST] jorgensen boundary is not correctly displayed

* implement a tool : brutal equation scanner

  say you've to find solutions for abc - a^2+b^2+c^2 = 0 (Marden's p.44)

  input "a" > complex > [-1,1,1,-1] (left,top,right,bottom) > incremental step 0.1
  input "b" > complex > [-1,1,1,-1] (left,top,right,bottom) > incremental step 0.1
  input "c" > complex > [-1,1,1,-1] (left,top,right,bottom) > incremental step 0.1

  input sharpness <= 0.001 (all values \delta so that |\delta|<0.001 are imputed as accepted solutions )

  creates a 3-nesting-level for-loop

  for( -1<= a.real <= 1, _a += 0.1 )
  {
       for( -1<= a.imag <= 1, _a += 0.1 )
  }

* question #1: is mobius map indecomposable ?
  question #2: is decomposition of a mobius map unique ?
  question #3: how can I decompose a mobius map ?
  question #4: how can I test if, given a decomposition, the first entry
               is equal to some given map ?
               For example, say that a map M decomposes into a ° B
               then AM resolves into AaB and then B.
               My goal is, given a group, to avoid cases like this one,
               which may often happen causing a waste of time, instead of
               computing B

* continue to develop poincare disk model class
  next step:
  given any couple of points in the disk, plot the d-line connecting them
  (you've already the disk from those two points, just compute the sector
   angle between them)

* continue to develop half-plane model class

* curvilinear polygon
  resume the development of _half_plane_polyline
  insert the param centers_array, after _pts_array,
  which replaces var _z0 inside the function itself and the call to
  method _half_plane_geodesic

------------------------ TESTS --------------------------------
* plugin GENERAL PURPOSE: implement the Jorgensen example in Marden's book at p. 44
  with comments, and share it on the web

* ROSA GROUP
   gen #1: 1.0,alpha,beta,1.0 | example alpha=0.5, beta=1.5
   gen #2: 1,0,c,1 | c is complex
   try other settings with alpha+beta=2

* TEST :
  consider a mobius map M, then develop a description about
  a same figure being mapped by M as b and c ranges so
  that a+b=2 and lim a = 2 and/or/xor lim b = 2

* TEST
  1) compute a cusp, say at 3/10
  2) take the related p/q word c
  3) construct a new group: a,b,c
  4) trigger it
  5) check whether convergence is again reasonably deep and fast

* TEST
  try displaying the modular grp by (1,0,-2,1) and (1,2,0,1)
  or by arranging the four circles

* TEST (sub-families of kleinian groups)
  - pick up a group (1) of mobius map : a, b, A, B
  - consider map a
  * EXAMPLE 1
  - factorize a into a couple of maps a1, b1
  - generate a new group (2) : a1, b1, A1, B1
  - render the limit set of (2)
  * EXAMPLE 2
  - divide map a by b and get the resulting a1
  - generate a new group (2) : a, a1, A, A1 or a1, b, A1, B
  - render the limit set of (2)


* maskit plugin:
  [EXPERIMENT #1] consider the current complex region. Take each point as
  the trace for generating the maskit group and test whether it's discrete
  through Jorgensen inequality. If so, plot that point into a canvas hosted inside
  the plugin.
  [EXPERIMENT #2] consider the maskit slice and plot as usual.
  Then take the b generator and turn it to z+4 and init generators again
  Render the new group after switching on LAST PT so we get it super-imposed.
  What it the new limit set ? Is a completely new one or just the latter shifted to the right by +2 ?

* [TEST] listings (continue...)
  prevent all warnings or errors.
  Start with "schottky disks" folder 

* ricostruire tutti i listings con random algebraic:
  >> aggiungere il primo punto fisso del commutatore abAB attraverso cmd fp

* Posso ottenere una lista dinamica delle funzioni disponibili per librerie del framework
  con relative descrizioni del risultato di ogni funzione + il ruolo dei parametri ?
  Per esempio in un file circles.triggers.lib.desc, contenuto nella stessa cartella
  di circles.triggers.lib.js
  ogni entry is announced by
  fn name:
  fn desc:
  fn param #1 with role
  fn param #2 with role
  ...
  fn param #n with role

* con la lista del punto precedente. Creare un form in cui gestire le j-unctions e le funzioni
  in esse contenute. Per adesso la funzione dei j-unctions e definita dal programma.
  Utilizzare le j-unctions per impostare delle azioni arbitrarie da parte dell'utente
  in determinate.
  Le azioni disponibili sono registrate in un array _glob_actions = [], in cui ogni
  elemento è definito da :
  idazione : 'render.3d.limit set'
  desc : 'render a 3d model of the limit set associated to the curren group'
  fns : '<call to a number functions in sequence>'
