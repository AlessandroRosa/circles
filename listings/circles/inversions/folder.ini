label=Inversions
sub.label.1=This folders include examples of discrete groups of inversions (or &lsquo;reflections&rsquo;) in the complex plane. Schottky groups refer to inversion disks, paired by the same letter (and different case): here mobius maps are first computed for small letters and then their respective inverse maps are assigned to elements associated to capital letters.<br>No such pairing holds for the examples in the 'inversion' folder, where each element is assigned to a different letter and thus relared to a different inversion map.
