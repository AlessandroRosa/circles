label=Schottky circles groups
sub.label.1=Examples inspired to a variant technique of standard circle inversion, introduced into the book Indra's Pearls, p. 101 and which I defined "Schottky circles" here for short. In opposite to the standard technique - where any inverse map/disk of each group item is represented by the exterior of the related bounded disk, here we only deal with bounded circular regions associated to Mobius maps inverting disks. The "Schottky circles" are associated to alphabet letters and the rendering is based upon a dictionary of so-called "reduced words", which optimize this IFS by missing otherwise cancelling combinations of inverse maps.
